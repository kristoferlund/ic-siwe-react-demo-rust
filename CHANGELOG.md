```
  isPreparingLogin: state.prepareLoginStatus === "preparing",
  isPrepareLoginError: state.prepareLoginStatus === "error",

  isLoginError: state.loginStatus === "error",
  isLoginSuccess: state.loginStatus === "success",

```
- Use v0.0.4 of the [ic_siwe_provider](https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-siwe/tree/main/packages/ic_siwe_provider) canister.


## [0.0.2] - 2024-01-16

### Added

- Preloading of SIWE messages! When a users wallet is connected, a SIWE message is requested from the provider canister. This
  means, when user clicks on the "Login" button, the SIWE message is already there and the user can sign it immediately. No
  more waiting for the message to be fetched from the provider canister.
